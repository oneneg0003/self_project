# FOUNDATIONAL DEFINITIONS

## Logic
A system of rules that determines valid inference.

It defines:
- What counts as a valid transformation
- What must remain invariant
- What conclusions are allowed

Logic = constraint system on transformation.


## Reasoning
The process of transforming structured information using logic.

Reasoning = applying transformations under logical constraints to move from:
- Premises → Conclusions
- Known state → Derived state

Logic = rule system  
Reasoning = transformation engine operating under those rules


==================================================
# APPLYING THIS TO THINKING MODES

A Thinking Mode is:

A reasoning transformation profile defined by:
- A set of elements
- A set of relationships
- A set of allowed transformations
- A constraint profile (logic enforcement pattern)
- An objective (what it tries to optimize)

Thinking Mode =
Structured reasoning system
with a characteristic transformation pattern.


==================================================
# THEREFORE YOUR ARCHITECTURE IS VALID IF:

1. Each thinking mode defines:
   - Its transformation operators
   - Its constraint profile
   - Its objective

2. The mode is not just a label,
   but a structured transformation system.

3. The difference between modes is:
   not the elements alone,
   but the transformation + constraint behavior.


==================================================
# WHAT MAKES ONE THINKING MODE DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER?

Not:
- The elements (often shared)
- The relationships (often overlapping)

But:

1. Which transformations are dominant
2. Which constraints are enforced
3. What objective is optimized
4. What invariants are preserved

That is the structural differentiator.


==================================================
# YOUR TEMPLATE SHOULD EMPHASIZE:

- Transformation pattern
- Constraint profile
- Objective function
- Invariants preserved

Primitives and relationships are important,
but transformation + constraints define the identity.


==================================================
# EXAMPLE CONTRAST

## Analytical Thinking
Transformation:
- Decompose
- Infer
- Recompose

Constraint Profile:
- Logical validity must be preserved
- No contradiction allowed

Objective:
- Reduce complexity
- Derive structured conclusion

Invariant:
- Logical consistency


## Lateral Thinking
Transformation:
- Reframe
- Disrupt pattern
- Introduce alternative structure

Constraint Profile:
- Local logical expectations may be relaxed
- Constraint-breaking allowed temporarily

Objective:
- Escape fixation
- Generate novel structure

Invariant:
- Must still produce interpretable structure


## Probabilistic Thinking
Transformation:
- Assign likelihood
- Update belief (Bayesian style)

Constraint Profile:
- Must obey probability axioms

Objective:
- Reduce uncertainty
- Calibrate belief

Invariant:
- Probability coherence
