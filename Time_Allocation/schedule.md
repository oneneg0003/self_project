# CATEGORY:ACADAMICS ,SKILL DEVELOPMENT(8:00 AM - 7:30 PM)
Acadamics:exam preparation+classes+assignment/assessments

Skill development:job preparation+Ml learning(basically rest fall in skill development)


# Case-NO-class
RATIO - <acadamics:skill development> = <30:70>

# Case-class

On avearge:
class:4 hours
Travel:1 hour(1/2 hour +1/2 hours)
exam prep+assessments/assigments:2 hours
rest(skill_development):11.5-7hours=4.5 hours


RATIO - <acadamics:skill development> = <7:4.5>


# Solution to increase the time allocation for skill_development activities

## Solution1: Overlap class with exam_prep+assessment

- Listen activiely
- Take structured notes
- clarify odubts same day

Then exam prep may reduce from 2hours->1 hour

New calculation:
class=4
travel=1
Exam_prep=1

Total_academic=6
remanining=5.5

new_RATIO - <acadamics:skill development> = <6:5.5>


## Solution2: Convert acadamic into skill development activities

-Try to convert attending class +exam_prep+assessments into skill development activities


New calculation:
class=4
travel=1
Exam_prep=1

Total_academic=6
remanining=5.5 
overlapping time:6 hours
skill_development :5.5+6=11.5 hours(huge improvement)

new_RATIO - <acadamics:skill development> = <6:5.5>
new_overlap ratio - <acadamics:skill development> = <6: (5.5)>

overlapping hours (extra)=6
