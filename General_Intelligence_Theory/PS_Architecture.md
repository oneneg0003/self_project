# User

Question:What the user needed to do to increase performance?

- Develop Liking and curiosity for problem solving

- Mindset:Every situation is an oppurtunity to learn and improve

- Creating and Memorizing the Problem solving tool kit ->to use it efficiently

- Practice eact part of the tool kit
    - step1:Find the activity to that supports
    - step2:Perform that activity

- Good problem selection

- Constraint training

- Make it Habitual activity
    - A skill becomes a habit only when you repeat it consistently in the same situation(when ever u find a problem) until it becomes automatic.
    - A skill becomes a habit only with consistent cue-based repetition. cue=problem,external source

- Accurate Feedback system and improvement system
    - Tools kit
        - Use reflective and reinforcement thinking modes and correspoding tools
    - Source 
        - Self(User)
        - External 
            - Nature
            - etc

- Import new (tools and tecniques,thinking modes) from external source eq:nature,user,math,cp,etc






Final Clean Structure

Your system + these additions:

Curiosity

Mindset

Toolkit

Structured practice

Good problem selection

Constraint training

Habit via cue

Feedback → Reflection → Reinforcement

Import new tools




# Environment
Question : What kind Environment user need to increase performance?

Environment → Sensory Input → Interpretation (Thought) → Emotion → Action → Feedback → Learning

- Environment characteristics the affects(for me):
    - Sensory Environment(Input control)
        - Cycle(Engagement)
            → Boredom (dopamine drop)
            → Brain searches for stimulation
            → Only available stimulation = cognitive objects
            → Cognitive object contains uncertainty in intellectual gap
            → Curiosity activated
            → Engagement
            → Exploration
            → Learning
        - Boredom (no external hits)
        - Cognitive objects (problems,books,art,nature,etc)
        - Cognitive objects contains uncertainity in intellectual gap
        - Cycle(Exploration)

    - Cognitive Environment(Thoughs)
        - Interpretation depends on user not enviroment so
        - Interpret inputs in a way that preserves clarity_map(responsibility), extracts structure, and converts difficulty into information.
        - Good Feeback intepretation(depends on user)
            - failure,success,silent,pain,delay= feedback
        - But enviroment still influence
            - accuracy
            - Speed
            - clarity
            - Structured
            - Emotional(partly depend on user interpretation)

    - Emotional-Motivational Enviroment
        Enviroment should provide ->
        - Motivational ,accurate ,reality showing Reward system
