============================================================
CANONICAL ACTION ARCHITECTURE (Revised with Pure Abstraction Model)
============================================================

User (Actor)
  ↓
Identity / Role (who am I in this action?)
  ↓
Context (environment / situation / domain)
  ↓
Stakeholders / Audience (who is affected? who evaluates success?)
  ↓
Purpose (why act? meaning / value)
  ↓
Job / Goal (what outcome must be achieved?)
  ↓
Success Definition (acceptance criteria / "done" condition)
  ↓
Priority (importance relative to other goals)
  ↓
Time Horizon (short-term / long-term orientation)
  ↓
Constraints (rules, limits, time, policies)
  ↓
Resources (time, attention, knowledge, energy, data available)
  ↓
Dependencies (information required, approvals, prior results, prerequisite knowledge)
  ↓
Preconditions (what must be true before starting)
  ↓
Assumptions (what is believed to be true)
  ↓
Evidence Base (what supports assumptions?)
  ↓
Uncertainty Map (knowns / unknowns / unknown unknowns)
  ↓
Risk Awareness (what can go wrong conceptually or procedurally?)

------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACTION DESCENT (Solution Logic Stack)
------------------------------------------------------------

Paradigm (general reasoning lens)
  ↓
Strategy (direction chosen under paradigm)
  ↓
Method (structured approach pattern)
  ↓
Algorithm (formal logical solution structure)
  ↓
Procedure (ordered execution steps)
  ↓
Implementation (concrete realization in environment/language)

------------------------------------------------------------
EXECUTION ENHANCEMENT LAYER (Attached to Implementation)
------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation
  ↘
    Technique (micro-level execution intelligence)
        ↘
          Tool (instrument or mechanism used)

------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROL & VALIDATION LOOP
------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation Output
  ↓
Checkpoints / Guardrails (self-check rules)
  ↓
Error Handling (what to do if contradictions appear)
  ↓
Metric(s) (how success is measured)
  ↓
Instrumentation (how measurement is obtained)
  ↓
Validation / Verification (correctness + robustness checks)
  ↓
Feedback (results from execution)
  ↓
Reflection (why it worked or failed)
  ↓
Decision Gate (Continue? Revise? Pivot?)

------------------------------------------------------------
LEARNING & ABSTRACTION LOOP
------------------------------------------------------------

Communication / Output Structuring
  ↓
Documentation (what to record for reuse)
  ↓
Skill Update (capability adjustment)
  ↓
Practice Plan (deliberate repetition)
  ↓
Knowledge Extraction (structural lesson learned)
  ↓
Abstraction / Schema Update (generalization into reusable template)
  ↓
Transfer Plan (where else this applies)

============================================================
Structural Notes
============================================================

• From Paradigm → Implementation = abstraction descent.
• Technique and Tool are not in the abstraction chain.
• They are execution enhancers attached to Implementation.
• The upper half governs reasoning.
• The lower half governs validation and learning.
• The model is now monotonic in abstraction and logically stable.

This version removes hierarchy contradictions.
