# COMPLETE PROBLEM SOLVING ARCHITECTURE (Stabilized Version)

Core Principle:
Each phase has one dominant cognitive function.
No duplication.
Clear boundaries.
Explicit feedback loops.

==================================================================

## 0️⃣ TRIGGER
Dominant Function: Awareness

Purpose:
Recognize that a problem or opportunity exists.

- Detect gap, anomaly, inefficiency, confusion, or goal
- Identify why it matters
- Decide whether it deserves structured solving

Output:
→ Problem recognized

==================================================================

## 1️⃣ FRAMING (Problem Definition Layer)
Dominant Function: Clarification

Purpose:
Define exactly what is being solved.

- Precise restatement
- Define success criteria
- Identify inputs, outputs, objectives
- Define scope and boundaries
- Identify stakeholders (if applicable)
- Classify problem type (optimization, proof, explanation, prediction, design)

Output:
→ Well-defined problem statement

==================================================================

## 2️⃣ INFORMATION & MODELING
Dominant Function: Structural Understanding

Purpose:
Build a structured representation of the problem.

A. Information Gathering
    - Collect givens
    - Separate knowns / unknowns / unknowables
    - Ask clarifying questions
    - Acquire missing data

B. Representation Engineering
    - Choose model form (algebraic, geometric, graph, probabilistic, algorithmic, simulation)
    - Define variables and states
    - Define measurable quantities

C. Structural Mapping
    - Variables (what can change)
    - Constraints (limits)
    - Relationships (interactions)
    - Goals (what must be achieved)
    - Invariants / symmetries
    - Degrees of freedom

D. Causal Analysis (when applicable)
    - Identify root causes
    - Distinguish symptom vs cause
    - Map cause–effect chains
    - Identify feedback loops
    - Analyze how root causes interact

Output:
→ Structured and causally mapped model

==================================================================

## 3️⃣ SEARCH SPACE DEFINITION
Dominant Function: Boundary Control

Purpose:
Define the solution space clearly.

- Explicit constraints
    - Logical
    - Physical
    - Computational
    - Resource
    - Ethical
    - Adversarial
- Assumptions
    - Explicit vs implicit
    - Domain vs temporary
    - Reversible vs irreversible
- Define allowed vs forbidden regions
- Identify edge and extreme cases
- Detect underdetermined vs overdetermined regimes

Output:
→ Clearly bounded solution space

==================================================================

## 4️⃣ GENERATION (Divergent Phase)
Dominant Function: Possibility Expansion

Purpose:
Create multiple candidate solutions.

- Generate multiple approaches
- Use analogy and transfer
- Extremal and limiting reasoning
- Controlled randomness
- Combine and cluster ideas
- Form competing hypotheses / candidates

Rule:
Never generate only one candidate.

Output:
→ Set of competing solution candidates

==================================================================

## 5️⃣ EVALUATION (Convergent Phase)
Dominant Function: Selection

Purpose:
Select the strongest candidate.

- Compare candidates using criteria:
    - Constraint satisfaction
    - Explanatory power
    - Simplicity
    - Generality
    - Risk vs benefit
    - Test cost vs information gain
- Eliminate weak candidates
- Select primary candidate (optionally backup)

Output:
→ Selected candidate with justification

==================================================================

## 6️⃣ CONSTRUCTION (Execution Phase)
Dominant Function: Implementation

Purpose:
Build the selected solution.

- Formal derivation / proof
- Algorithm implementation
- Prototype building
- Simulation execution
- Step-by-step development

Output:
→ Concrete artifact (solution, model, proof, design, plan)

==================================================================

## 7️⃣ VALIDATION (Robustness Testing)
Dominant Function: Critical Testing

Purpose:
Ensure correctness and robustness.

- Internal logical consistency
- Edge and boundary case testing
- Stress and adversarial tests
- Sensitivity analysis
- Compare predicted vs actual behavior
- Redundancy checks

If failure:
→ Loop back to Phase 4 or 2 depending on cause

Output:
→ Verified solution OR identified failure

==================================================================

## 8️⃣ DECISION
Dominant Function: Commitment

Purpose:
Commit or revise.

- Accept / Reject / Revise
- Choose trade-offs explicitly
- Assess confidence level
- Document limitations

Output:
→ Final committed solution

==================================================================

## 9️⃣ DEPLOYMENT
Dominant Function: Application

Purpose:
Apply in real context.

- Implement in environment
- Communicate assumptions and limits
- Monitor early performance

==================================================================

## 🔟 REFLECTION
Dominant Function: Meta-Cognition

Purpose:
Extract learning from outcome.

- What worked?
- What failed?
- Where were assumptions wrong?
- Where was time wasted?
- Which signals were ignored?

Output:
→ Explicit lessons

==================================================================

## 1️⃣1️⃣ GENERALIZATION (Schema Formation)
Dominant Function: Abstraction

Purpose:
Extract reusable structure.

- Identify structural pattern
- Extract reusable template
- Identify triggering cues
- Compress into schema or checklist

Output:
→ Reusable mental model

==================================================================

## 1️⃣2️⃣ REINFORCEMENT LOOP (Meta-Level)
Dominant Function: Adjusting based on feedback from step_10(introspection+retrospection)
[Reinforcement](https://github.com/negzero/skills/blob/main/cp_road_map2.md)
- Improve tools
- Improve evaluation criteria
- Improve search heuristics
- Expand model library
- Reduce future cognitive load
based on feeback from step_10

Loop:
Returns to Phase 1 for next problem
