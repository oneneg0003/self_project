# 🛠 2️⃣ Practicing Strategy

Core Principle:
Git must be used in real work, not only practice repos.

--------------------------------------------

## Rule 1: Use Git in Every Project

Every coding project:
- Initialize Git
- Create branches
- Make meaningful commits
- Push to GitHub

Even small scripts.

--------------------------------------------

## Rule 2: Use Feature Branch Workflow

Never work only on main.

Workflow:
main
↓
feature/<name>
↓
merge or rebase
↓
push

--------------------------------------------

## Rule 3: Use GitHub Actively

- Push frequently
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Use pull requests (even solo)
- Review your own diffs
- Use tags for versions

--------------------------------------------

## Rule 4: Simulate Team Environment

Even if working alone:
- Create multiple branches
- Merge in different orders
- Use force-with-lease carefully
- Resolve conflicts

--------------------------------------------

## Rule 5: Practice History Hygiene

Before pushing:
- Squash unnecessary commits
- Rebase cleanly
- Remove debug commits
- Write proper commit messages

Clean history = professional workflow.

--------------------------------------------

## Rule 6: Build Recovery Confidence

At least once per week:
- Reset hard
- Delete branch
- Recover using reflog

Fear disappears when recovery is practiced.

============================================================

# 🧠 3️⃣ Mastery Philosophy

Memorization → Basic Skill  
Application → Competence  
Failure Recovery → Confidence  
Clean History → Professionalism  

Git mastery = Control over history.

If you are afraid of a command,
you haven't practiced it enough.
