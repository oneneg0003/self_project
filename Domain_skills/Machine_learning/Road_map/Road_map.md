# 🏗️ Does This Roadmap Include System Design?

## 🔎 Short Answer

YES — but at an ML-system level, not full distributed systems design.

---

# 🧠 What Is “System Design” Normally?

In general software engineering, system design means:

- Designing scalable systems
- Load balancing
- Microservices
- Caching layers
- Databases at scale
- Distributed systems
- Fault tolerance
- Horizontal scaling
- Message queues
- Cloud architecture

That is heavy backend system design (like Google/Meta interviews).

Your roadmap does NOT go that deep.

And it should not — you're an undergraduate.

---

# 🤖 What Kind of System Design IS Included?

Your roadmap includes:

## 1️⃣ ML System Design (Entry-Level)

This appears in:

STAGE 5 (Backend + Deployment)  
STAGE 6 (Data Engineering)  
STAGE 7 (MLOps)  
STAGE 9 (ML System Design)

This covers:

- Batch vs real-time inference
- How model is served
- How data flows
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Retraining loop
- Drift detection
- Model versioning

That IS system design — but scoped to ML systems.

---

# 📦 What That Actually Means

Instead of thinking:

"Which model gives best accuracy?"

You think:

- Where does data come from?
- How often is it updated?
- How is it validated?
- Where is model stored?
- How does API load it?
- What happens if model fails?
- How do we update model safely?
- How do we monitor drift?

That is ML system design thinking.

---

# 🎯 Example: Recommendation System

Basic thinking:
Train collaborative filtering model.

System design thinking:
- Where is user data stored?
- Is recommendation real-time or batch?
- How often do we retrain?
- How do we cache recommendations?
- What if traffic increases?
- What if model latency > 200ms?

That’s system thinking.

---

# 🧱 What Is NOT Included (And You Don’t Need Yet)

You do NOT need:

- Designing distributed training clusters
- Kubernetes architecture mastery
- Load balancer configuration
- CAP theorem
- Sharding strategies
- Designing YouTube from scratch

That is senior-level backend system design.

---

# 🧠 Final Clarity

Your roadmap includes:

✔ ML pipeline design  
✔ Data pipeline thinking  
✔ Deployment architecture  
✔ Monitoring strategy  
✔ Retraining strategy  

That IS system design — for ML engineering level.

It does NOT include:

❌ Advanced distributed systems  
❌ Large-scale backend architecture  

And that is correct for your level.

---

# 🔑 Final One-Line Answer

Yes, your roadmap includes ML-focused system design,
but not heavy distributed backend system design —
and that is exactly what an undergraduate ML Engineer needs.
