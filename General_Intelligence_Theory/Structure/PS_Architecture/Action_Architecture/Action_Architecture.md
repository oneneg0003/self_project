For EACH Phase in PS_Phases:

# CANONICAL ACTION ARCHITECTURE (PS-Integrated Version)

User (Actor)
  ↓
Identity / Role (who am I in this action?)
  ↓
Context (environment / situation / domain)
  ↓
Stakeholders / Audience (who is affected? who evaluates success?)
  ↓
Purpose (why act? meaning / value)
  ↓
Job / Goal (what outcome must be achieved?)
  ↓
Success Definition (acceptance criteria / "done" condition)
  ↓
Priority (importance relative to other goals)
  ↓
Time Horizon (short-term / long-term orientation)
  ↓
Constraints (rules, limits, time, policies)
  ↓
Resources (time, attention, knowledge, energy, data available)
  ↓
Dependencies (information required, approvals, prior results, prerequisite knowledge)
  ↓
Preconditions (what must be true before starting)
  ↓
Assumptions (what is believed to be true)
  ↓
Evidence Base (what supports assumptions?)
  ↓
Uncertainty Map (knowns / unknowns / unknown unknowns)
  ↓
Risk Awareness (what can go wrong conceptually or procedurally?)
  ↓
Paradigm (general problem-solving lens)
  ↓
Strategy (high-level plan)
  ↓
Alternatives Considered (other possible approaches)
  ↓
Selection Rationale (why this strategy?)
  ↓
Tactics (concrete moves inside strategy)
  ↓
Toolset (mechanisms used: models, frameworks, heuristics, representations)
  ↓
Techniques / Methods (rules for using the tools)
  ↓
Skill Needed (capability required to execute techniques correctly)
  ↓
Algorithm (abstract step logic, if applicable)
  ↓
Procedure (concrete step-by-step execution)
  ↓
Checkpoints / Guardrails (self-check rules)
  ↓
Error Handling (what to do if reasoning fails or result contradicts goal)
  ↓
Metric(s) (how success is measured)
  ↓
Instrumentation (how measurement is obtained)
  ↓
Validation / Verification (correctness + robustness checks)
  ↓
Feedback (results from execution)
  ↓
Reflection (why it worked or failed)
  ↓
Decision Gate (Continue? Revise? Pivot?)
  ↓
Communication / Output Structuring (how result is expressed)
  ↓
Documentation (what to record for reuse)
  ↓
Skill Update (capability adjustment)
  ↓
Practice Plan (deliberate repetition)
  ↓
Knowledge Extraction (structural lesson learned)
  ↓
Abstraction / Schema Update (generalization into reusable template)
  ↓
Transfer Plan (where else this applies)
