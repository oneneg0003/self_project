# Math Learning Roadmap

1. Algebra + Abstract Algebra
   - Learn basic algebra: equations, polynomials, functions, inequalities.
   - Then study abstract algebra: groups, rings, fields, homomorphisms, isomorphisms.
   - Foundation for all later topics.

2. Discrete Mathematics
   - Logic, proofs, sets, functions, relations.
   - Mathematical induction.
   - Counting principles (permutations, combinations).
   - Basic modular arithmetic.
   - Builds reasoning and proof skills.

3. Combinatorics
   - Counting problems, binomial coefficients.
   - Pigeonhole principle.
   - Inclusion–exclusion principle.
   - Recurrence relations.
   - Requires algebra and discrete math reasoning.

4. Number Theory (Elementary → Advanced → Algebraic)
   - Elementary: primes, divisibility, gcd, modular arithmetic.
   - Advanced: Fermat, Euler, Diophantine equations, quadratic residues.
   - Algebraic: number fields, rings of integers, ideals, unique factorization.
   - Depends on algebra and combinatorics.

5. Modular Arithmetic
   - Congruence relations, modular inverses.
   - Chinese Remainder Theorem.
   - Modular exponentiation.
   - Applications in cryptography.
   - Often studied alongside number theory.

6. Graph Theory
   - Graphs, trees, connectivity, paths.
   - Planar graphs, coloring, isomorphism.
   - Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.).
   - Follows naturally from discrete math and combinatorics.

7. Geometry (Circles, Polygons, etc.)
   - Euclidean geometry: triangles, circles, polygons.
   - Coordinate geometry and analytic methods.
   - Transformations, loci, trigonometry basics.
   - Enhanced understanding through algebraic concepts.

8. Probability and Statistics
   - Basic probability rules, random variables.
   - Expectation, variance, distributions.
   - Combinatorial probability.
   - Descriptive and inferential statistics.
   - Relies on combinatorics and algebra.
