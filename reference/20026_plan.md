> Skill-development is **specific**

- Self-development → who you are
- Skills → what you can do
- Activities → how you practice

### Self-developement advantages and disadvantages


### Self-development goals







## CORE ALGORITHM (Your System)

### Step-by-Step
1. Identify the self-development task
2. Convert it into a problem
3. Find the cause
4. Find the solution (usually skill-based)
5. Identify which skill supports the solution
6. Practice that skill via activities

> Every self-development goal **dilutes into skills**,  
> not directly into activities.

- Activities are **tools**
- Skills are the **unit of growth**

❌ “I meditate” (activity)  
✅ “I train attention control” (skill)
