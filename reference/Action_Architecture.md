# Layer Interpretation

Meaning Layer:
- Purpose

Outcome Layer:
- Job / Goal

Execution Layer:
- Strategy
- Tool
- Techniques
- Procedure

Control Layer:
- Metric
- Feedback

Development Layer:
- Skill
- Practice


# What "Procedure" Executes in the Canonical Architecture

Procedure
= the step-by-step sequence that OPERATIONALIZES the Tool
according to the Techniques
to achieve the Job/Goal.

So:

- Tool = what mechanism you will use
- Techniques = rules for using that tool (when/how/how much)
- Procedure = the exact ordered steps where you APPLY the tool in reality

--------------------------------------------------

# Canonical Relationship (Most Precise Form)

Strategy decides: what kind of approach
Tool provides: the mechanism
Techniques decide: the usage rules
Procedure specifies: the step-by-step application of the tool (under those rules)

--------------------------------------------------

# Mini Example (Analytical Thinking)

Tool:
Decomposition

Techniques:
- Top-down split when goal is clear
- Bottom-up grouping when data is messy
- Stop splitting when parts become directly solvable

Procedure (actual execution of the tool):
1. Write the goal in one sentence
2. List all known constraints
3. Split the problem into 3–5 subproblems
4. For each subproblem, define inputs/outputs
5. Solve subproblems in dependency order
6. Integrate results into final solution

--------------------------------------------------

# One-Line Answer

Procedure is the step-by-step plan for USING the tool
(as governed by techniques)
to achieve the job/goal.



----------------------------------
# Exact Structural Relationship

Canonical Architecture
= Structural anatomy of ONE action.

PS Phases
= Temporal control system for solving a problem over time.

--------------------------------------------------

# What Canonical Does Well

Canonical ensures:
- Alignment (Purpose → Goal → Strategy)
- Correct tool usage
- Clear execution
- Feedback loop
- Skill improvement

It answers:
> "Is this action internally structured correctly?"

It does NOT tell you:
- When to diverge vs converge
- When to stop generating ideas
- When to validate
- When to reflect
- When to generalize

That is timeline control.

--------------------------------------------------

# What PS Phases Do

PS Phases control:
- Order of cognition
- Switching thinking modes
- Managing uncertainty
- Handling feedback loops
- Moving from exploration → selection → validation

It answers:
> "What stage am I in right now?"

That is process orchestration.

--------------------------------------------------

# Why Canonical Cannot Replace PS Phases

Because:

Canonical is vertical.
PS Phases are horizontal.

Analogy:

Canonical = internal structure of a move.
PS Phases = sequence of moves in a game.

A move can be well-structured,
but without sequence control, the game collapses.

--------------------------------------------------

# Is PS Phase Itself a Canonical Form?

No.

PS Phase is not:
Purpose → Tool → Technique structure.

PS Phase is:
Trigger → Framing → Modeling → Generation → Evaluation → ...

It is a time-based control architecture.

However:

Inside EACH phase,
you can apply Canonical.

Relationship:

PS Phase (timeline)
    contains
Canonical (structure of each action inside phase)

--------------------------------------------------

# Final Stabilized Structure

PS Phases = WHEN to think.
Canonical = HOW to structure each thinking act.
Development Model = HOW to improve the thinker.

Three axes.
No redundancy.
No replacement.









# Relationship

# Combined Model

HORIZONTAL = Problem Solving Phases (Time Flow)
VERTICAL = Canonical Action Architecture (Decision Layers)

----------------------------------------------------------------

For EACH Phase in PS_Phases:

Phase X
  ↓
  Job (What is this phase trying to achieve?)
  ↓
  Strategy (What approach fits this phase?)
  ↓
  Tool (What mechanism do I use here?)
  ↓
  Techniques (How do I apply it?)
  ↓
  Procedure (Concrete steps in this phase)
  ↓
  Metric (How do I know this phase succeeded?)
  ↓
  Skill (Capability required to do this well)
  ↓
  Practice (If weak, how to improve it)
